        A self-taught <span className="highlight">developer</span> - though it feels wrong to say "self-taught" when I've had plenty of guidance from friends and we all learn through community-driven online resources.
        <br/>
        <br />
        My coding journey began when a friend introduced me to FreeCodeCamp as a way to dip my toes into coding. At first I felt indifferent about it but I stuck with it, and now I can say that I truly enjoy it! ðŸ’œ
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I work with <span className='highlight'>JavaScript</span>, <span className="highlight">ReactJS</span> and <span className="hightlight">NodeJS</span>. I've done some freelance gigs and although my main focus is in front-end work, my goal is to become a full-stack developer. 
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton and compose music!
